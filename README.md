## 🚀 About this project
I'm currently learning **Frontend Development** and pushing myself by copying famous websites to understand their structure, layout, and styles.  
This project is a **YouTube clone** where I focus on practicing **HTML, CSS (and later JavaScript)**.  

It's not about reinventing the wheel, but about **training my eyes and hands** to build clean, responsive, and scalable UIs.  

## 🎯 Goals
- Improve my **HTML & CSS skills**  
- Understand how big platforms design their layouts  
- Learn by **re-creating, not just reading**  
- Challenge myself with real-world inspired projects  

## 🛠️ Technologies
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (vanilla, no frameworks for now)

Learning frontend is the same — the best way is to experiment and **copy what works** until I can create my own.
